  <b>Local musician:</b>
   Piper has always loved music, and had a natural talent for picking up beats and rhythms, which she puts into her keyboard tracks. She loves to play, but doesn’t have much experience playing in front of audiences or getting his music heard and breaking out into the music industry. She uses FollowTheMusicTM to connect with other musicians in her area and to promote her weekly performances at the club, reaching new audiences looking for local performances. She hopes that by using the app he’s able to connect more with local talent, get her name out there, and be able to keep doing what she loves--making music!

  <b>Busy adult who doesn’t have time to make music anymore:</b>
  Reed is a middle-aged worker in the financial industry in NYC. Though he once dreamed of becoming a musician, today he does not have much time to connect with his musical passion or with friends. A midlife crisis lead his to decide to play and listen to musical jam sessions like he used to in college, but he does not know anyone to do so with him anymore. He recently signed up for Follow the Music after hearing about it from a coworker, but is not very familiar with using modern consumer applications, having had little time to explore beyond the scope of his work. He needs to be able to find jam sessions around his tight schedule and needs the flexibility to cancel them if he is asked to stay late at his office.
